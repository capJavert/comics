    <meta name="description" content="It isn't often that you hear anything during the night in the area of Framold, it is a peaceful town in the country of Namiron. This was before all else a magical land filled with all kinds beings and creatures. All you can usually hear is a dog barking here and there or songs coming from the tavern, but ever since the king got sick strange things started happening in Namiron and the Kings Fanatical oldest son, want a good substitute for his wise father king Orht. Monsters started appearing and prince Topsir wouldn't listen to the mages and priests from his father's counsel, all he would listen to was the leader of the Red Moon cult Ithob. Once a beautiful land is now but a shadow of its former self.">
